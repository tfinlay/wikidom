<h1>WikiDom by <a href="https://tfinlay.io">@tfinlay</a></h1>
<p>
    An "I'm feeling lucky"-style search engine that takes the name of a website and redirects you to the website itself using the power of Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/aaronjanse">@aaronjanse</a>'s
    WebExtension implementation (<a href="https://github.com/aaronjanse/dns-over-wikipedia">dns-over-wikipedia</a>)
    and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33830759">discussion on Hacker News</a>.
    The primary differentiator is that this implementation requires no extension to be installed.
</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
    Wikipedia articles often contain official URLs of websites.
    This website allows you to provide the name of an article, and will automatically look up the URL associated with that name in Wikipedia.
    If one is found, you will be redirected to that URL!<br/>
    All of this is done in your browser, so information about your search queries is not visible to me.
</p>
<p>
    Obviously, since it's Wikipedia, the URL you're directed to cannot be guaranteed to be correct all the time, so use at your own risk!
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
    To begin using this site, simply add <code>#q=&lt;your query here&gt;</code> on to the end of the current URL.
</p>
<p>
    For example, to search for "Hacker News", go to <code id="example_hn"></code>, which will correctly redirect you to <code>https://news.ycombinator.com/</code>
</p>

<h4>Convenience</h4>
<p>
    If you want to start using this site more regularly, you can add this site as a search engine to integrate it more into your browser.<br/>
    In some browsers, you can then choose to search with this alternate search engine some of the time.
</p>

<p>
    Firefox:
    <ol>
        <li>Add this page as a search engine by following <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox#w_add-a-search-engine-from-the-address-bar" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.</li>
        <li>Optionally, go to search settings, choose WikiDom, and double click on the "Keyword" cell next to it to assign it to a keyword (e.g. <code>wikidom</code>)</li>
        <li>Then, to search with WikiDom instead of your default search engine, type @wikidom before your query. If you chose not to assign it a keyword, you can also select it through the GUI.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Other browsers: I don't know a nice built-in way to do this (<a href="https://github.com/tfinlay/wikidom/issues/1">please let me know if you do!</a>), so I suggest adding the link below to your bookmarks bar. You can click it on non-protected pages to search!<br/>
    <a href="javascript:(()=>{const query=prompt('What would you like to search with WikiDom?'); if (query){window.open('https://wikidom.tfinlay.io/#q=' + encodeURIComponent(query))} })()">WikiDom Quick Search</a>
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    document.getElementById("example_hn").innerText = window.location.toString().split(/#/, 1)[0] + "#q=Hacker%20News";
</script>
